# TinyRayTracerPython

As most part of my research is going to be coded in python, I recreated a ray tracer similar to the one I created in C++ (https://github.com/moezdurrani/tinyRayTracer) in python using numpy.

The first part was writing an image to the disk, here is the [code](https://github.com/moezdurrani/TinyRayTracerPython/blob/main/Codes/ImageToDisk.py).

I programmed a 3D sphere using the alogirthm given [here](https://github.com/moezdurrani/TinyRayTracerPython/blob/main/Codes/3DSphere.py)
