# TinyRayTracerPython

As part of my research, I have developed a ray tracer in Python called TinyRayTracerPython. This project is inspired by my previous implementation in C++ (https://github.com/moezdurrani/tinyRayTracer) and has been rewritten using numpy.

## Image Rendering
The first step in this project was to implement image rendering and saving. The code for this functionality can be found [here](https://github.com/moezdurrani/TinyRayTracerPython/blob/main/Codes/ImageToDisk.py).

## Creating a 3D Sphere
Next, I implemented a 3D sphere using an algorithm provided [here](https://github.com/moezdurrani/TinyRayTracerPython/blob/main/Codes/3DSphere.py).

## Multiple Spheres
Building on the 3D sphere, I extended the ray tracer to support rendering multiple spheres. The code for this can be found [here](https://github.com/moezdurrani/TinyRayTracerPython/blob/main/Codes/MultipleSpheres.py).

## Adding Lights
To enhance the scene, I introduced lighting effects. The code for adding lights to the scene can be found [here](https://github.com/moezdurrani/TinyRayTracerPython/blob/main/Codes/Lights.py).

## Reflections
Using the Phong Reflection Model, I implemented reflections for the lights in the scene. The code for this feature can be found [here](https://github.com/moezdurrani/TinyRayTracerPython/blob/main/Codes/Reflections.py).

## Shadows
To create realistic lighting, I added shadows to the scene. The code for implementing shadows can be found [here](https://github.com/moezdurrani/TinyRayTracerPython/blob/main/Codes/Shadows.py).

## Refractions
To simulate the refraction of light, I implemented refractions in the ray tracer. The algorithm used for this feature can be found [here](https://github.com/moezdurrani/TinyRayTracerPython/blob/main/Codes/Refractions.py).

## Chessboard
A Chessboard was added in the background temporarily to properly observe how the laws of optics are working. The code was added [here](https://github.com/moezdurrani/TinyRayTracerPython/blob/main/Codes/ChessBoard.py).

## Background Image
Instead of a constant color background, I created a circular image to serve as the background. The code for generating the background image can be found [here](https://github.com/moezdurrani/TinyRayTracerPython/blob/main/Codes/Environment.py).

## Chessboard Removal
For the purposes of this project, the chessboard was removed from the scene. The modified code without the chessboard can be found [here](https://github.com/moezdurrani/TinyRayTracerPython/blob/main/Codes/NoChessBoard.py).

## 3D Models (.obj Files Rendered)

| First Image                                 | Second Image                                | Third Image                                 |

An [algorithm](https://github.com/moezdurrani/TinyRayTracerPyt/blob/master/model.py) was implemented to read the vertices and faces from the meshes of triangulated 3D models. These vertices and faces were utilized to render the models in our scene. The rendering time varied based on the complexity of the models. Below is a summary of the .obj files and the time it took to render them:

| Model     | Vertices | Triangles | Rendering Time (minutes) |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-------------------------|
| Model 1   | 84       | 28        | 26                      |
| Model 2   | 60       | 20        | 16                      |
| Model 3   | 240      | 80        | 65                      |
